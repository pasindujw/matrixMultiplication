##### Question given #####
1. Write a sequential program to perform matrix-matrix multiplication
	Dimensions of each matrix is n×n and elements/values of the matrix are of type Double.
	Populate each matrix with randomly generated Double values.
	Add necessary code to measure the time taken by the matrix-matrix multiplication. 
	Do not measure the time to create matrixes and populate them with values.
The program should be written in C++ targeting the Linux environment.
2. Identify a suitable library for C++ and Linux environment that supports “parallel for” loops.
3. Write another C++ program to perform the matrix-matrix multiplication using a “parallel for”
loop.
